Understanding the key reasons behind customer churn and build strategies to reduce churn by predicting which customers are likely to leave based on the data provided. 

Problem Statement: In the current business landscape, particularly in sectors such as telecommunications, retail, subscription services, and banking, retaining customers plays a key role in sustaining profitability. It is much more cost-efficient to keep existing customers than to attract new ones. Research indicates that acquiring a new customer can be 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining a current one. Despite the importance of customer retention, many companies grapple with the issue of customer churn.

Customer churn refers to the occurrence when customers stop buying from or subscribing to a company’s offerings. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including dissatisfaction with the product, more attractive offers from competitors, subpar customer service, or shifts in customer needs.

Why it's important: 
Customer Retention Costs:
It’s much cheaper to keep existing customers than to find new ones. In fact, research shows that acquiring a new customer can be five to twenty-five times more expensive than retaining the ones you already have. By predicting which customers are likely to leave and understanding the reasons behind it, businesses can better allocate resources to strategies that keep customers happy and engaged. This approach also helps reduce marketing costs for bringing in new clients.

Revenue Impact:
Customer churn has a direct impact on a company’s bottom line. When many customers are leaving, it often points to underlying problems with the product, customer service, or user experience. By identifying customers who are at risk of churning, businesses can tackle these issues head-on, ultimately increasing the lifetime value of each customer and boosting revenue in the long run.

Competitive Advantage:
Understanding why customers are leaving also provides valuable insights into your competition. If customers are jumping ship for better deals or offers from competitors, you can adjust your pricing, services, or customer engagement strategies to stay competitive and retain your edge in the market.
