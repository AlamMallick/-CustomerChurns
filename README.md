# -CustomerChurns
Understanding the key reasons behind customer churn and build strategies to reduce churn by predicting which customers are likely to leave based on the data provided. 

Problem Statement: "Our project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical data. Customer churn refers to the loss of clients, and predicting churn in advance allows businesses to take preventive actions to retain customers and improve revenue."

Why it's important: "Reducing customer churn is crucial for increasing customer retention, lowering customer acquisition costs, and boosting long-term profitability for businesses."
